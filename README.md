# Egyptology

Hello,

The idea behind this project was to create a resource for those interested in Egyptian culture to discover more about it's history. Therefore, the site has alot of general information about why one should study egypt and a brief overview of it's vast history. 

This website hopes to educate anyone interested in Egypt and keep it's users informed on a regular basis, through it's newsletter, of various aspects of the field of Egyptology. 

## Existing Features 

- Navigation Dropdown Menu
    - Featured on each of the three pages. This responsive menu which drops down when the user hovers contains links to Home, Gallery and Sign Up pages. 
    - Same design on each page to make it easy for the user to navigate and dropdown feature prevents the header from looking cluttered.

    - Main image with text overlay which describes exactly what Egyptology is.
    - Added an animation of the sun crossing the sky to make it appealing to the user when the page is loaded.

- Gallery 
    - The gallery page has videos embedded which give extra information regarding the pharaoh Tutankhamun.
    - This is useful to the user as it displays exactly what Egyptology is about and is more visually stimulating than reading text.

## Future Features

- Slideshow 
    - An interactive slideshow on the gallery page which would have images of various Egyptian artefacts which the user would find interesting. 

- Updated Timeline 
    - A more detailed and complex timeline would be added to the index page. This timeline would incorporate alot more dates and would be viusally more appealling. 

## Testing 

I have tested wach of the pages in order to ensure everything is working as intended. There are no broken links. The embed videos function correctly and I have implemented form validation for the newsletter form. 

On a desktop screen everything looks and runs perfectly. I have added responsive design in order to ensure the website looks good on a variety of screens. 

However, the smallest screen size I tested, Galaxy Fold, using Chrome Developed Tools makes the website less than optimal due to it's small size.

## Validator Testing
- Html - No errors returned when passing through W3C validator
- CSS - No errors returned when passing through W3C CSS validator

## Unfixed Bugs 
- N/A

## Deployment 

- Site deployed to Github Pages:
    - The steps to deploy are as follows:
    Go to the settings tab on Github repository.
    - Click on Github pages tab on the sidebar, select main branch on the dropdown menu. 
    - Following this, the page will be re-loaded with a detailed ribbon display to indicate it was successful.
