        <p id="study_egypt">Ancient Egypt was the most advanced civilization of the ancient world. They built the pyramids and magnificent temples.
            Their understanding of medical science was much more progressive than that of their peers and they perfected the art of mummification.
            Moreover, Egyptian mythology is among the richest in the world and through studying it we can come to understand how the ancient 
            Egyptians understood life, death and the world around them. To put things into perspective, another ancient culture, the Greeks also revered 
            Egypt as the progenitors of civilization. Compared to some of the earliest Greek myths like <i>The Iliad</i> or <i>The Odyssey</i> which were composed around 900 B.C, the pyramids of Egypt 
            were built thousands of years earlier. All these reasons form the basis as to why it is important to study ancient Egypt today.</p>

            According to Egyptian mythology there existed life after death. This idea stemmed from their observations of the world around
            them which was cyclical in nature. For example, they noticed that the sun always rose in the east and set in the west. Also, 
            Spring and the growth of nature was followed by Winter and death. Therefore, the belief was that life could be achieved after death
            depending on if the right conditions were met. As such, the body had to be perserved through mummification and placed in a properly adorned 
            tomb in order for the deceased to have everything they would require in the afterlife.

            The practice of mummification began as early as 2400 B.C and continued all the way up until Egypt became a province of the Roman
            Empire. During the Old Kingdom period it was believed that only the pharaohs could attain life after death. However, around 2000 B.C 
            attitudes began to change and it was thought that anyone could achieve this provided that they were mummified and buried accordingly. 
            The <i>Book of the Dead</i>, a collection of ancient funerary texts, were entombed with the deceased in order for them to navigate through the afterlife 
            and unite with the god of the dead, Osiris.

            A combination of chemicals were used to dry the corpse which was left for 35-40 days. The organs of the deceased were removed and 
            placed in canopic jars which were buried with them. The body was the covered in resin and linen, as many as 35 layers. During the Middle Kingdom 
            placing funerary masks over the deceased became common practice. The most famous of these being Tutankhamun's, see our <a href="gallery.html">gallery</a> page to view video evidence of this.
            The Egyptians also mummified animals, including cats. Cats were highly valued in Egyptian households for their ability to hunt rats and mice 
            who infested granaries. Thus, they were entombed with their owner to assist them in the afterlife.
