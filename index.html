        <h3 class="main-headings">Why Study Egypt <i class="fa-solid fa-scale-unbalanced-flip" style="color: #daa520;"></i></h3>
        <p>Ancient Egypt was the most advanced civilization of the ancient world. They built the pyramids and magnificent temples.
            Their understanding of medical science was much more progressive than that of their peers and they perfected the art of mummification.
            Moreover, Egyptian mythology is among the richest in the world and through studying it we can come to understand how the ancient 
            Egyptians understood life, death and the world around them. To put things into perspective, another ancient culture, the Greeks also revered 
            Egypt as the progenitors of civilization. Compared to some of the earliest Greek myths like <i>The Iliad</i> or <i>The Odyssey</i> which were composed around 900 B.C, the pyramids of Egypt 
            were built thousands of years earlier. All these reasons form the basis as to why it is important to study ancient Egypt today.</p>
